# Rock-paper-Scissor
Rock-Paper-Scissor using Mern Stak Development
I created a Rock Paper Scissors game using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The game allows two players to play against each other through a clean and interactive interface made with React.

On the backend, I used Node.js and Express to handle the game logic and store the results in MongoDB. This way, the game can keep track of scores and game history.

Using React, I made the game responsive and updated the screen based on the playersâ€™ choices in real-time. This project helped me learn how to build a full web application with both front-end and back-end working together smoothly.
